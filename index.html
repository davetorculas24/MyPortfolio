								<p class="mb-4 text-dark">To be successful, I need to be able to work at things and stay dedicated to things I put my mind to. I also need to be able to stay on task and/or be dedicated to what I'm trying to be successful at. Failure to these things will cause failure as a whole, therefore failure is not an option. I also need to be smart with my money to be successful financially. In short I want to successful at all my financial and other ventures and nothing less than success will suffice.</p>
							</div>
							<div >
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark">To be intelligent, I need to have the ability to do my school work at school and at home. I need to have the discipline to study and to do homework and to pay attention in class, and go the extra mile it takes to reach my goals. Being intelligent will help me to get a good job and good friends. It will also help me make wise decisions across the board. Wise decisions are a big part of being a good, intelligent person.</p>
							</div>
							<div >
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark ">To be respected, I need to show respect back to other people. Most people will not show respect to a person who does not show respect to them. I also need to be a fair and moral person, because otherwise people would see me as a person who does not give people the chance they deserve and one who will do anything to get what they want. Neither of these images are good images, nor do I want people to think of them when they think of me.</p>
							</div>

								<!-- <h3 class="mb-4 mt -5">Skills I Possess</h3> -->
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark ">I am a computer literate with good communications skills. And also I like editing of music and video where I learned it through exploring. I want a person who is motivated in life and have a good moral character.</p>
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark ">    A person needs to achieve certain goals in one's life before you can call them successful. Success is to achieve goals, you have set. I have set certain goals I would like to achieve in my lifetime. Some of these goals are personal while others are professional. My professional goals in life are to find a good job that makes me happy, get a good education, find a job that makes enough money for me to support my family, and help people.</p>
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark ">     Another professional goal of mine is for me to be making good money in my work. I am not saying that I need to be making millions but I want enough so I can help support my family. I cannot expect to have a family I can't afford. My job will help me buy a home, pay health insurance, and other things I need for my family. My main goal in the money is to keep, my family happy. I want them to have enough but not too much. I want them to have the necessities.</p>
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark "> My dream company should be the one offering me with job responsibilities where I could use my qualifications, strengths, capabilities and skills. I would be able to offer my best to help the company achieve greater business goals and profitability, while I also set landmarks along my career path.</p>
								<p class="mb-4 text-dark ">To sum it up, Iâ€™d love a position where I can use my skills to make an impact that I can see with my own eyes. Of course, the position is only part of the equation. Being at a company where I can grow and work toward something I care about matters, too.

									But as of now I want to be a freelancer though other says that it is better to work in government but for me it is nice to work at home set up, aside of less expenses were also the salary is big.
