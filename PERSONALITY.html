									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Work responsibility is when an employee completes all of their job duties stated within the job description and adheres to company policy and procedures professionally and to the best of their ability. When you are responsible at work, you establish yourself as a valuable employee and a dependable coworker. Your daily actions at work, your behavior at special work-related events, and how you treat other employees all play a role in responsibility at work. The type of job-specific responsibilities you have and the expectations placed on your behavior at work depend on your workplace environment and your specific role. Being a responsible intern is for improving the productivity of the company.

									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Demonstrating Adaptability and Flexibility</strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Adaptability and flexibility are fundamental workplace skills that benefit any employee, regardless of their level or field. Now more than ever, organizations value individuals who can easily adapt to change, as adaptability and flexibility can vastly improve career performance and progress.

									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Being a Team Player</strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Good team players understand what the team needs to do and why. And they know how their skills and attributes contribute to collective effort.  Simply taking orders from others is a fast track to resentment and disengagement. When you are playing for the team, you know where you are, why you are there and how to support and enhance the work of others. Make it your priority to recognize and encourage teammates in their work when something goes well. If there is a challenge, reach out to teammates if you can help. Because you understand your collective goals – and how you and your teammates all contribute in reaching those goals – you can offer advice and help when you encounter obstacles. But be careful. People respond well when they know that you are genuine and that criticism is constructive and helpful and geared to the accomplishment of a joint objective. So be sincere as well as honest. Real team players do not undermine colleagues to score points. </p>

								<div >
									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Being Punctual and Efficient </strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Punctuality is a wonderful trait of a person, one to be admired and respected. Punctuality displays a person’s respect for people and time. In a scheduled appointment, the late-comer usually gives an impression that he/she doesn’t value the other person’s time or considers his/her time more important than that of the other. This is exactly why candidates are never late at a job interview!</p>
								</div>
								<div >
									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Being Self-directed </strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Activities and resources, such as self-guided reading, participation in study groups, internships,
										Electronic dialogues, and reflective writing activities.

									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Make time for the most important people in your life, namely your family and loved ones. If your personal life is in order and your relationships outside of your workplace are healthy, it’ll spill over to your job in a good way (and the opposite is also true). Never overlook the importance of a solid work-life balance.</p>

								</div>
								<div >
									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Being cooperative </strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Competition makes it difficult to share our skills, experiences and resources because each person is separately involved in his or her exclusive goal. In our schools and work places, students and employees are often taught to regard each other not as potential collaborators, but rather as opponents, rivals, and obstacles to their own success. In cooperative settings, every person's role is important and valued. Individuality is respected, and concern for the needs of others fostered. The challenge shifts from "striving to be number one" to working toward a mutual goal. The idea that we all share in decision-making is a powerful tool.</p>
								</div>
								<div >
									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Being self-motivated </strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Self-motivation can help you develop a drive and determination to complete various tasks and goals throughout the workday. If you display high levels of self-motivation within the workplace, it will become noticeable that you're achieving more goals and are working harder to succeed. Strong self-motivation at work helps increase your productivity and makes you feel proud of the goals you've accomplished.

										Self-motivation and the drive to achieve can lead to promotions at work, strong and trusting relationships with team members and the opportunity to work on more projects you enjoy and are passionate about.
										</p>
								</div>
								<div >
									<h4 class="mb-4 mt -5"><strong>Demonstrating good time management</strong>  </h4>
									<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Time management skills are behavioral and organizational techniques and attitudes that help to improve your productivity and manage your workload. Management of time also has a direct impact on colleagues and is the missing link in a poorly performing team. It's also considered to be an important soft skill . 

										Being deliberate and consistent in managing the most precious resource of time, you will not only be able to do more - you will also have the option of doing less but doing it better. As mental health concerns and burnout plague our workplaces, this second factor cannot be ignored. Being productive also means having more time to relax. This is especially important since most of us struggle with being productive while working from home .
