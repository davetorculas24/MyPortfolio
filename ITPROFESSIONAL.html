								<p class="mb-4 text-dark">Career opportunities in computer and information technology are growing.
									The gap between these opportunities and those qualified to fill the positions is also growing. As technology evolves daily, so does the need for new, innovative employees with the latest up-to-date training to enter the field.

									Working technology is a necessity for just about every occupation. The options are endless, from government and healthcare to small businesses and agriculture.
									Many IT positions are typical office hours, but you may be able to find positions that allow you to work remotely, work during odd hours or work on a project-by-project basis. When youâ€™re skilled at what you do, where and when you do it may be flexible.
